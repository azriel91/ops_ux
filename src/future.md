# Future

## To Do

* Dry run.
* Make API ergonomic.
* More granular execution.
* Refine shared data access.
* Handle signals (like `SIGINT`).

## More Ideas

* Use `choochoo` not just for the deployment tool, but the agent running on the web server.
* Split core functionality, have web frontend.
* Serialize state to disk &ndash; save / load execution.
