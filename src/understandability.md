# Understandability

> Presentation / verbosity.

Show information when it's relevant, hide information when it's not.

## Maturity Levels

Show the user 200 MB of uncoloured logs per minute.

The ultimate complexity is simplicity.

* Show progress detail for current step, hide detail when it's done.
* Highlight important information, dim contextual information.

</details>

## API Implications

* Collect typed data, present it differently:
    - Real time interactive CLI presentation.
    - Renderable report.
* `choochoo` just deals with progress strings for now.
