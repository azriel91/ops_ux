# Dimensions

In this book, a dimension is defined as a particular nature of something. Dimensions may be independent, and may be measurable. Some dimensions may be derived from and may be influenced by others.

For example, an object's dimensions are:

* Size
* Mass
* Temperature
* Colour

## Software Dimensions

We will look at the following software dimensions, and show how [`choochoo`] supports building software with higher maturity levels of user friendliness.

1. **Path Handling:** How exhaustive code path coverage is, and how each path is handled.
2. **State Visibility:** What state is it in now, progress tracking.
3. **Understandability:** Presentation / verbosity.
4. **Recoverability / Repeatability:** Can execution resume from halfway.
5. **Performance / Efficiency:** How well is execution scheduled, time spent, and resources used.
6. **Psychology:** Did the user request what they intended?
