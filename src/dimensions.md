# Dimensions

In the physical world, an object has different dimensions such as:

* Size &ndash; width, height, depth
* Mass
* Temperature
* Colour
* Shape

Dimensions can be independent; some dimensions may be derived from or are influenced by others.

We will look at the following dimensions.

1. **Path Handling:** How exhaustive code path coverage is, and how each path is handled.
2. **State Visibility:** What state is it in now, progress tracking.
3. **Understandability:** Presentation / verbosity.
4. **Recoverability / Repeatability:** Can execution resume from halfway.
5. **Performance / Efficiency:** How well is the execution scheduled, or resources used.
6. **Psychology:** Did the user request what they intended?

For now, this book does not cover:

* Code maintainability
* Security
